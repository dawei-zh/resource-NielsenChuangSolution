# Nielsen and Chuang Quantum Computation and Quantum Information

## About

Nowadays, quantum computation and quantum information techniques are rapidly developing, and the textbook <u>*Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang</u> is one of fundamental textbook for quantum computing beginner (PDF version is accessible in this repository). I will include the solution of all exercises/problems of quantum computation, and hope these information help the quantum computation and quantum information community. **I will keep this repository updated.**

Here is a brief introduction of content in each directory. 

<!--* The `derivation` directory contains derivation of some equation in the textbook -->
* The `solution` directory includes my detailed solutions to exercises and problems in the textbook. 

There are some other repositories at Github that includes solutions of exercises and problems in the textbook, but most of them are not comprehensive and not newly updated. Please refer to following links for more information, and please contact me if I do not include any other related resources.
