# Solution of Nielsen and Chuang

I include my solution of problems in the book *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, and this **will be** a complete solution to all problems. I hope this would also be a good resource for the learner of QC. Note that I do not guaranteed 100% of correctness of my solution, please use at your own risk and let me know if you have any questions. 

Note also that I am still working on solving all the problem sets and hopefully it would be done by 06/2022. The series of textbook problem solving repository is inspired by Zhong-Zhi Xianyu and Yihui-He
