## Exercise 2.25

Suppose $A$ is an arbitrary operator and $|v\rangle$ is arbitrary vector, we can compute the inner product of $|v\rangle$ and $A^{\dagger}A|v\rangle$ as
$$
\left(|v\rangle, A^{\dagger}A|v\rangle\right) = \langle v|A^{\dagger}A|v\rangle \tag{1}\label{1}
$$
Suppose $|u\rangle = A|v\rangle$ then eq. $\eqref{1}$ becomes $\langle v|A^{\dagger}A|v\rangle = \langle u|u\rangle$. According to the properties of inner product, we have $\langle u|u\rangle \geq 0$. That is, for arbitrary operator $A$ and arbitrary vector $|u\rangle$, we always have
$$
\langle v|A^{\dagger}A|v\rangle = \langle u|u\rangle \geq 0\tag{2}
$$
Thus, we could conclude that $A^{\dagger}A$ is positive.
