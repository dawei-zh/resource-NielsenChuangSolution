# Quantum Computation

I will include some useful information for learners of quantum computation, and these files are finished during my learning of quantum computation from $0$ to $1$. Hope you could find useful information here. 

Here is a brief introduction of content in each directory.

* The `Nielsen+Chuang` directory contains some useful information for quantum computation learner who wants to start from the book *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang. People can find 
  * solutions of all problem sets in the book
  * details of derivation of some equation in the book
